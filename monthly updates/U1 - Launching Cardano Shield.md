# Launching Cardano Shield

*Hello Cardano Community,*

We're thrilled to share our first major update on the Cardano Shield project, an Open-Source initiative dedicated to enhancing security within the Cardano ecosystem. We're especially proud to announce that our project has been selected in Fund10 of Project Catalyst. This achievement not only fuels our mission but also reinforces the community's trust in our capabilities.

### Team Formation
Our journey started with assembling a dedicated team and welcoming our partners from [@adabox.io](https://twitter.com/AdaBoxIO) to officially join the GeroWallet team, each member bringing unique skills in the Cardano Blockchain, Cybersecurity, Design, Q&A, and AI & ML.

GeroWallet approached Adabox for collaboration due to their dedication to Cardano and their expertise in web3 development. From previous experience they displayed strong work ethic and possess exceptional skills, making them an ideal team to spearhead CardanoShield. Dudi, particularly esteemed in the Cardano community, stands out for his proficiency in Java and numerous contributions to the Cardano community. Notably, he actively supports the decentralized network through his own Israel stake pool :ISR. 

Adam, a jack of all trades within Adabox, showcases his proficiency as a musician and recording engineer. Beyond his musical prowess, he also excels as a designer and master project manager, consistently demonstrating an ability to simply get shit done. The combination of Dudi's technical ability and Adam's diverse skill set provides the essential components to elevate CardanoShield to greatness.

### Analyzing Security Risks
A significant part of our initial phase involved a deep dive into the prevalent threats in the Cardano ecosystem. By understanding these risks in detail, we're better equipped to develop targeted solutions.

Developing AI/ML Models for Threat Detection
With the support of Project Catalyst, we've begun developing AI/ML models to detect and counteract these threats. This involves extensive data analysis and model training, ensuring our solutions are as effective and adaptive as possible, when the time is right we will share more in-depth details regarding said models 

### Looking Forward
This update marks just the start of our journey. We're committed to continuously improving and evolving our strategies to ensure the Cardano ecosystem remains secure and resilient.
